**Target user profile**: University students who need to keep track of their contacts from different classes/ccas/clubs etc.

**Value proposition**: Students often take many classes and meet different people. This app helps them to organise their
contacts list for an easier way to set up proper communication channels. This makes it easier for students to form
connections with their peers during their time in University.

**User stories**:
Update the target user profile and value proposition to match the project direction you have selected. Give a list of
the user stories (and update/delete existing ones, if applicable), including priorities. This can include user stories
considered but will not be included in the final product.

**Use cases**: Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative user stories that need multiple steps to complete.
Adding a tag to a person (assume the user needs to find the person first) Non-functional requirements: Note: Many of the
given project constraints can be considered NFRs. You can add more. e.g. performance requirements, usability
requirements, scalability requirements, etc.

**Glossary** : Define terms that are worth recording.

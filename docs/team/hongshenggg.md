# Project: BookFace

## Overview

BookFace is an NUS-centered contacts management system that allows students
of NUS to organise their list of friends and acquaintances that they have
met in their various classes, CCAs, project groups etc. The application aims
to provide NUS students a means to keep track of the contact details of th
numerous people they have met during their time in NUS in hopes of facilitating
better communication among peers, as well as provide a centralised channel for
students to obtain relevant administrative contact information of the various
departments and faculties that are in the school.

## Overview
BookFace is a NUS-centered contact management application that allows students to keep track of details of people they 
have met in the campus, for example in situations such as having the same CCAs, same classes. It can even be adding 
people due to the simplest reason by labeling them as 'acquaintance' or 'classmate'. It is intended to act as a digital 
means of storing contacts to help NUS students organize their university contacts in one place such that they can easily 
look it up whenever they want. In addition, the application also comes with import point of contacts with the professors
which are categorized based on the school that the users are in.
